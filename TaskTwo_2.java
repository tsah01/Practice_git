/**
 * Task :Ask user to choose the following option first: 
 *          If User Enter 1 - Addition  
 *           If User Enter 2 - Subtraction 
 *           If User Enter 3 - Division		 
 *           If User Enter 4 - Multiplication  
 *           If User Enter 5 – Average.
 *   - Ask user to enter the 2 numbers in a variable for first and 
 *    second(first and second are variable names) for the first 4 options mentioned above and print the result. 
 *   - Ask user to enter two more numbers as first1 and second2 for calculating the average as soon as	 user choose an option 5. 
 *     At the end if the answer of any operation is Negative print a statement saying “Oops option X(1/2/3/4/5/) is returning the negative number” 
 *   - NOTE: At a time user can perform one action at a time.   
 * This file is an implementation of the above task.
